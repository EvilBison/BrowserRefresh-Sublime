{"name":"Browser Refresh","tagline":"Save the file you are working on and refresh your browser with one keystroke","body":"# Browser Refresh for Sublime Text\r\n\r\nAfter installing this plugin you can hit `command + shift + r` on Mac OS X or `ctrl + shift + r` on Windows while using your favorite browser, the last active window will come to the foreground *(optional in Chrome, Canary, Safari and WebKit on Mac)* and reload the active tab. If the current file is unsaved, it will be saved before the browser is activated and reloaded.\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\nTo edit settings go to `Preferences > Package Settings > Browser Refresh`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"keys\": [\"command+shift+r\"], \"command\": \"browser_refresh\", \"args\": {\r\n            \"auto_save\": true,\r\n            \"delay\": 0.5,\r\n            \"activate_browser\": true,\r\n            \"browser_name\" : \"Google Chrome\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**auto_save**  \r\nIf set to `true` you current file in Sublime Text will be save before refreshing the browser window.\r\n\r\n**delay**  \r\nAdds a delay (in seconds) before triggering the refresh. Seems to be useful if you are using a CSS or JavaScript pre-processor. The default is 0.0 seconds. \r\n\r\n**activate_browser**  \r\nIf set to `true` when you press the keys it will bring the browser to the foreground. **Note:** On Windows this setting is always `true`.\r\n\r\n**browser_name**  \r\nSpecify which browser to use. The default is `all` which will try to refresh all running browser on your system. You can change to be more specific: `Google Chrome`, `Google Chrome Canary`, `Safari`, `WebKit`, `Firefox`, `Opera`, `IE`, `Iron`.\r\n\r\n**Note**: on Windows use `Google Chrome` if you want to use Canary, because at the moment it's very hard to distinguish between them as both report themselves as Chrome. This also means that if you have both Chrome and Canary running, it will refresh the active tab on both browsers.\r\n\r\n## Supported Browsers\r\n- Google Chrome (Mac, Win)\r\n- Google Chrome Canary (Mac, Win - see note above)\r\n- Safari (Mac, Win)\r\n- WebKit (Mac)\r\n- Firefox (Mac, Win)\r\n- Opera (Mac, Win)\r\n- Internet Explorer (Win)\r\n- SRWare Iron (Win)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to install\r\n**With the Package Control plugin**  \r\nThe easiest way to install **Browser Refresh** is through Package Control, which can be found at [http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).\r\n\r\n**Without Git**  \r\nDownload the latest source from GitHub and copy the BrowserRefresh folder to your Sublime Text \"Packages\" directory.\r\n\r\n**With Git**  \r\nClone the repository in your Sublime Text \"Packages\" directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/gcollazo/BrowserRefresh-Sublime.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\nIf you have the time to make this plugin better feel free to fork and submit a pull request.
